## **Project Description:**

Tile Matching Game

## **Introduction:**

Welcome to the Tile Matching Game project! It's like a game where you flip cards to find a matching pair similar to “Mahjong”. You'll be making a game on the computer where players can match pictures using React.

## **Project Steps:**

### Step 1: Enter Your Name:

- Before playing, the user provides their name, which is stored in the browser's local storage.
- Look at the example: Welcome Screen ( [Click Here](https://new-assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/welcome-screen-1.png) )

### **Step 2: Play the Game:**

- After submitting their name, the user can start playing the game.
- Your game will look like this: Game Board ( [Click Here](https://new-assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/bord-game.png) )

### Step 3: What to Do:

- The user's job in the game is to reveal matching tiles on the board in a timely manner.

### **Step 4: Picking Tiles:**

- Users can click on any tile to turn it over and see what's there.

### Step 5: Keeping Score:

- When the user matches two tiles, they are awarded 1 point.
- If the user fails to match the tiles, 1 point is deducted.
- The current score is displayed in the top left corner of the board.

### Step 6: Watching the Clock:

- The app tracks how much time the user spends in solving the entire board, displayed in the top right corner of the board.

### Step 7: Finishing Up:

- When the user matches all the tiles, you'll see a screen that tells you how well he/she did and how long it took.
- Look at this example: Success Screen ( [Click Here](https://new-assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/success.png) )

## What You Need to Make:

1. React Application:
    - Create a React application with appropriate components and state management.
2. **User Name Entry Component:**
    - Implement a component for entering the user's name and storing it in the browser's local storage.
3. **Game Board Component:**
    - Develop a component to display the game board with interactive tiles.
4. **Game Logic:**
    - Implement the game logic for matching tiles, scoring, and time tracking.
5. **Success Screen Component:**
    - Create a component to display the success screen with the final score and time taken.
